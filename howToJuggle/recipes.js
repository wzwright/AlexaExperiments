    "1 ball": "Throw it in the air. Catch it with either hand. Repeat.",
    "2 balls": "Put one ball in each hand. Throw one in the air, about head level. Throw the other one in the air before the first one comes back down to your hands. Catch the first one, and throw it back up. Continue catching and throwing.",
    "3 balls": "Put one ball in one hand and two in the other. Throw one from the two ball hand in the air, about head level. Throw the ball from the other hand in the air before the first one reaches the top of the arc. Throw the third before either lands. Catch the first one in the hand that started with one ball and throw it back up right away. Continue catching the balls in alternating hands and throwing them back up immediately.",

Catch the first ball in the hand that didn't start, throw it back up immediately, and continue catching and then throwing in alternating hands.",

    "more balls": "I think this is impossible."
